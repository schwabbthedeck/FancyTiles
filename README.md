# Fancy Tiles App
The Fancy Tiles App is a SharePoint App that creates a web part that renders list items into 'tiles'. The tiles are based on a configuration list in the app web.

### Overview
The Fancy Tiles App is used to create the Fancy Tiles Web Part on any page in the site the add-in has been installed on.

### Installation
Dowload a copy of the latest FancyTiles.app file in the Releases folder.
Upload that file to the App Catalog in the Apps for SharePoint library.

### Adding the Fancy Tiles App to your site
To use the Fancy Tiles App on your page, it must be added to your site first.
Navigate to the Site Contents of the site in which you want to install it. 
Select "Add an App", locate the Fancy Tiles App, and install it.

### Configure Fancy Tiles List
Clicking into the app after it has finished installing will take you to the app landing page.
The "Fancy Tiles List" is the list used to collect all tiles that you want to display. 
A "Group Keyword" is used on each item to specify what group of tiles you want to show.
Example items are already added to the list when it is installed. 
A link on the app landing page will take you to the list.

### Adding and Configuring Announcements Web Part
Once the Announcements app has been added to the site, you can add the web part as you would add any other web part to the page by selecting "Fancy Tiles Web Part".
Once the web part has been added, access the web part's property panel. To specify which group the web part should show, update the "Fancy Tiles Group Keyword" property under the "Fancy Tiles Properties" heading.
